# git add .

When changes have been made inside a Git repopsitory that you want to keep, you need to use the `git add .` command. 

Items that have not been "tracked" before will start to be tracked and all other changes will be marked as modified. 

Generally, you can get away with `git add .` which will add ALL Files and directories that were added,  changed or deleted.

You can track changes to specific files using `git add file1 file2` which will tack specifically file1 and file2.

You can specify tracking directories with `git add DirectoryName`.
