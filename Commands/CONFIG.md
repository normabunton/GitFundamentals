# git config

When first setting up Git, you'll need to work with Git config commands in order to set up your identity.

For example, your identity can be set up with the commands such as:

~~~
git config --global user.name "Norma Bunton"
git config --global user.email te_nj25@hotmail.com
~~~

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup) documentation.
