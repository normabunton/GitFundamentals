# git init

The `git init` command is used to create and empty repository. 

If you want to create a new directory and initialize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```

mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDiectoy
git init
```

Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as 
[ status ](./Status.md),
[ add .](./Add.md),
[ commit ](./Commit.md),
[ push ](./Push.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current dirctory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
